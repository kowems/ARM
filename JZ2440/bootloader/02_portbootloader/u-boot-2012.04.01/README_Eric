1. new a board for 2440 based on u-boot-2012.04.01
    cd board/samsung/
    cp smdk2410 smdk2440 -r
    cd ../../include/configs
    cp smdk2410.h smdk2440.h
  modify boards.cfg
    add smdk2440
2. clock setting is wrong in origin source. setup clock in start.S, not in board_early_init_f
3. serial output is wrong.It seem that not define CONFIG_S3C2440 macro,so define CONFIG_S3C2440,disable CONFIG_S3C2410 in include/configs/smdk2440.h file
4. build error(nand code error),disable CONFIG_CMD_NAND macro
